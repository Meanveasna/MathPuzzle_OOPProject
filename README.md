# 🧮 Math Puzzle Game - OOP Project

A comprehensive Math Puzzle Game built using **Flutter** and **Dart**, demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project features multiple game modes to challenge your calculation speed, logical thinking, and accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎮 Game Modes
1.  **Quick Calculation** ⚡
    *   Race against the clock! Solve as many math problems as you can within the time limit.
    *   Dynamic difficulty scaling.
    *   Test your mental math speed.

2.  **Logical Puzzle** 🧩
    *   Challenge your brain with number sequences and pattern recognition.
    *   Find the missing number to complete the puzzle.
    *   A test of logic and observation.

3.  **True / False** ✅❌
    *   Fast-paced decision making.
    *   Determine if the given equation is correct or incorrect.
    *   Tests your reflexes and accuracy.

### ✨ Key Functionalities
